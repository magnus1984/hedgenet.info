   :alt: Deploying a static website DevOps style

AWS S3 makes it really easy to host a website composed entirely of static 
assets. This is especially well suited for hosting the output of static 
websites generators such as `jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>`_, 
`nikola <https://getnikola.com/>`_ or `gatsby <https://www.gatsbyjs.org/>`_. 
In this tutorial, I will show you how you can deploy your static website on S3 
with an SSL certificate created in Certificate Manager.  I will be using this 
blog as a use case and show you how you can leverage AWS tools such as 
CloudFormation, CodeBuild and CodePipeline to completely automate the 
deployment of new content to as many environment as you like. 
Let's get started !

Objective and tasks breakdown
-----------------------------
Our objective at the end of this will be to have enduser access a website using
https. we will also want fully automated deployments of new content so that
publishing is triggered by a simple commit. We will break down the tasks of
this tutorial in 3 parts:

1. Prerequisite.
2. Infrastructure.
3. DevOps pipeline.

In the prerequisite section, we will focus on obtaining a certificate for
our website from AWS Certificate Manager.

In the infrastructure section, we will present the architecture required to
support our static website. We will be using a CloudFormation template
to specify and deploy our website.

Finally, in the DevOps pipeline section, we will create a pipeline that 
automatically triggers an update of our website upon a commit on the MASTER
branch of our site repository.

The CloudFormation templates used in this tutorial are all available on 
github.

Prerequisite
------------
https requires you to have a certificate issued by a certificate authority
in order to operate properly. Here we will be requesting a certificate from
AWS Certificate Manager for a domain name purchased with AWS Route 53. Here
are the instructions to get your certificate:

1. login to the aws console at `<https://console.aws.amazon.com>`_
2.

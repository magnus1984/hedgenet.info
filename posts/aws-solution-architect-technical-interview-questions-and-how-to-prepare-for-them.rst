Recently, I was given the chance to interview with Amazon Web Services for a solutions architect position in Montreal. I decided it would be interesting 
to share my experience of *the 90 minutes technical phone interview* that is part of their hiring process. In this post, I want to talk about:

1. The general interview process for SA at AWS.
2. The format of their 90 minutes technical phone interview.
3. The way I prepared for the interview.
4. Specific techical questions asked and my answers.

By sharing this experience, I hope I can shed some light on what's expected of IT professionnals at companies like AWS. I also want to help you prepare 
in case you are waiting for your phone technical interview for a similar role at AWS or even elsewhere. Let's get started !

**NOTE**: If you are only interested in the list of the actual questions I was asked during the interview to help you prepare, please find it 
in `this section <Specific interview questions_>`_

The Software Architect hiring proces
------------------------------------
The role I applied for is officially named: AWS Bilingual Solutions Architect. After applying online, I was contacted by an AWS staff member describing the 
hiring process. Here it is as I understood it:

   Solutions Architect hiring *pipeline* 

There are two main events that are part the interview process:

1. The 90 minutes phone technical interview (a technical phone screening).
2. The 5-8 hours onsite interview (an in person behavioral assessment).

During the whole interview process, you will talk to AWS staff members in a non-interview context about 3 to 4 times for 15 to 30 minutes each. They talk to you so 
that they can help you *prepare* for your interviews. These conversation are simply a review of what's to come and what the person conducting the interview will 
expect to hear during this particular phase of the process. It's also your chances to ask any questions you might have. Make sure to ask the same questions to
everyone you speak to in order to make sure that the answers you get are reliable. Sometimes they are not. For example, when I asked a staff member what was the 
success rate of the onsite interview for SA, I was given different answers ranging from 10% to 60%. I suspect that this rate varies depending on how badly they feel 
they need to fill a particular position at a particular point in time.

If you need travel arragement for your onsite interview, they will fly you from your point A to their point B and take care of hosting you during your time their.
AWS require that you arrive 1 day before the interview is to take place and they will allow you to fly home the day of the interview or the day after. Depending
on your choices, you will be in the city of your onsite interview from 2 to 3 days.

I felt that the staff members are quick to respond and that it was generally pleasant to deal with them.

There are orther details about the interview process which are interesting, like the instruction they give you about a presentation you will have to give during your
onsite interview, but what I want to focus on today is the technical phone screening. 

Format of the 90 Minutes technical phone interview
--------------------------------------------------
The technical interview is a 90 minutes phone call with a software architect during which 80% of the time is spent on technical questions and the remaining 20% 
is spent on behavioral questions. I *strongly suggest* that you focus most of your preparation energy on the technical side here. I also suggest that you understand
how you are expected to steer the interview when responding to questions. This is what I describe next.

Technical Questions
+++++++++++++++++++
All of the technical questions have the same format and only differ by their subject matter. The interviewer starts by describing a situation or a problem and then
ask for a solution or your opinion. These questions will be vague and, without additional context, only terse, general answers without much content will come up 
to mind. *That* is what you must understand: these technical questions are *meant* to be the starting point of a *conversation* with the interviewer. If you ask 
the interviewer for more context before giving an answer, you will find that is answers are *scripted*. This means that they prepared in advance for this eventuality 
and thus *expected* this behavior from you. Let's illustrate this point with a concrete question example. 
It will show you how things should unfold from the start of the question:

    The conversation must flow from the initial questions

The AWS technical interviewer will never give you any *direct* feedback on the answer you provide to questions. If you answer is first question directly with one word,
he will just move on to the next question. Do not expect them to *ellicit directly* the behavior I just described. They want to see this arise naturally in you.

Before I post what I believe is the most detailed transcript of a SA phone interview at AWS, let me describe the behavioral part of the interview first.

Interview Preparation
---------------------
Broad knowledge about the question categories mentionned above is what you need to succeed this interview. The more you know what the subject matter in the 
interview questions, the more obvious it will be to you to ask the right follow up questions.
